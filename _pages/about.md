About me
------
I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at the University of Virginia, advised by [Dr. Arsalan Heydarian](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/arsalan-heydarian) and [Dr. Brad Campbell](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/brad-campbell). My research interests lie at the intersection of Large Language Model (LLM) agents and Cyber-Physical Systems. Currently, my work focuses on developing LLM agent systems and their applications in smart cities and buildings, intelligent transportation systems, and autonomous driving, among others.

I am particularly passionate about autonomous driving. If you are working on related topics and are open to potential collaboration, please feel free to reach outâ€”I would be delighted to connect!
